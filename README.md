## 🤓 Case <a name = "case"></a>

As a developer and expert on SQL, you were contacted by a company that needs your help to manage their database which runs on PostgreSQL. The database provided contains four entities: Employee, Office, Countries and States. The company has different headquarters in various places around the world, in turn, each headquarters has a group of employees of which it is hierarchically organized and each employee may have a supervisor. You are also provided with the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

## 🛠️ Docker Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

---

## 📚 Recover the data to your machine <a name = "data_recovery"></a>

Open your terminal and run the follows commands:

1. This will create a container for postgresql:

```
docker run --name nerdery-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123 -p 5432:5432 -d --rm postgres:15.2
```

2. Now, we access the container:

```
docker exec -it -u postgres nerdery-container psql
```

3. Create the database:

```
create database nerdery_challenge;
```

5. Close the database connection:

```
\q
```

4. Restore de postgres backup file

```
cat src/dump.sql | docker exec -i postgres_container psql -U postgres -d nerdery_challenge2
```

- Note: The `...` mean the location where the src folder is located on your computer
- Your data is now on your database to use for the challenge

## 📊 Excersises <a name = "excersises"></a>

Now it's your turn to write SQL queries to achieve the following results (You need to write the query in the section `Your query here` on each question):

1. Total money of all the accounts group by types.

```sql
SELECT type account_type,
    ROUND(SUM(mount)::numeric, 2) money_sum
FROM accounts
GROUP BY type;
```

2. How many users with at least 2 `CURRENT_ACCOUNT`.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_user_at_least_2_current_account
FROM (
        SELECT u.id
        FROM users u
            INNER JOIN accounts a ON u.id = a.user_id
        WHERE a.type = 'CURRENT_ACCOUNT'
        GROUP BY u.id
        HAVING COUNT(u.id) > 1
    );
```

3. List the top five accounts with more money.

```sql
SELECT id,
    account_id,
    type,
    mount
FROM accounts
ORDER BY mount DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

4. Get the three users with the most money after making movements.

```sql
-- I MAKE SURE I USE EVERY ACCOUNT BY UNION ALL!
-- INNER JOIN MAY LEAVE OUT USERS WITH NO MOVEMENTS
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_accounts_final_balance() RETURNS TABLE(account_id UUID, money NUMERIC(15, 2)) AS $$ BEGIN RETURN QUERY WITH accounts_money_movements AS (
        (
            -- account_from transactions
            SELECT account_from AS account_id,
                CASE
                    WHEN type = 'IN' THEN mount
                    ELSE mount * -1
                END AS mount
            FROM movements
        )
        UNION ALL
        (
            -- account_to transactions
            SELECT CASE
                    WHEN type = 'TRANSFER' THEN account_to
                    ELSE account_from
                END AS account_id,
                CASE
                    WHEN type = 'TRANSFER' THEN mount
                    ELSE 0
                END AS mount
            FROM movements
        )
        UNION ALL
        (
            -- accounts starting money
            SELECT id AS account_id,
                mount
            FROM accounts
        )
    )
SELECT am.account_id,
    ROUND(SUM(am.mount)::NUMERIC, 2) AS money
FROM accounts_money_movements am
GROUP BY am.account_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
--
-- Solution applying function  get_accounts_final_balance
--
SELECT u.id,
    u.name,
    SUM (ab.money) all_money
FROM get_accounts_final_balance() ab
    INNER JOIN accounts a ON ab.account_id = a.id
    INNER JOIN users u ON u.id = a.user_id
GROUP BY u.id,
    u.name
ORDER BY all_money DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

5. In this part you need to create a transaction with the following steps:

    a. First, get the ammount for the account `3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf` and `fd244313-36e5-4a17-a27c-f8265bc46590` after all their movements.
    b. Add a new movement with the information:
        from: `3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf` make a transfer to `fd244313-36e5-4a17-a27c-f8265bc46590`
        mount: 50.75

    c. Add a new movement with the information:
        from: `3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf`
        type: OUT
        mount: 731823.56

        * Note: if the account does not have enough money you need to reject this insert and make a rollback for the entire transaction

    d. Put your answer here if the transaction fails(YES/NO):

    ```sql
        --Yes, not enough money for literal C transaction
    ```

    e. If the transaction fails, make the correction on step _c_ to avoid the failure:

    ```sql
        -- Errors fails were corrected using a EXCEPTION statement
    ```

    f. Once the transaction is correct, make a commit

    e. How much money the account `fd244313-36e5-4a17-a27c-f8265bc46590` have:

    FINAL SOLUTION_

6. All the movements and the user information with the account `3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf`

7. The name and email of the user with the highest money in all his/her accounts

```sql
SELECT u.name, u.email, SUM(ab.money) money_balance FROM get_accounts_final_balance() ab
INNER JOIN accounts a ON a.id = ab.account_id 
INNER JOIN users u ON u.id = a.user_id
GROUP BY u.name, u.email
ORDER BY money_balance DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

8. Show all the movements for the user `Kaden.Gusikowski@gmail.com` order by account type and created_at on the movements table

```sql
